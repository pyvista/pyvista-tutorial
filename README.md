# PyVista Tutorial

## Abstract

This tutorial will introduce 3D data visualization using PyVista (https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista).
PyVista offers 3D plotting and mesh analysis through a streamlined interface for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).
PyVista uses VTK (http://www.vtk.org) under the covers and provides a very Python-friendly API.

At the end of the tutorial users will be able to

- Use PyVista effectively to create 3D visualizations. 
- Understand the basic class structure of PyVista.

### Tutorial Prerequisites.

#. Basic knowledge of Python to get started. Get jupyterlab on your machine and be up and running.
#. Intermediate users will want to be familiar with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and other libraries that are compatible with PyVista, like `trimesh` or `meshio`.
