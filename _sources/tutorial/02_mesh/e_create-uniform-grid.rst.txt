Creating a Uniform Grid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a simple uniform grid from a 3D NumPy array of values.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 8-12

.. code-block:: default


    import numpy as np
    import pyvista as pv








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 13-17

Take a 3D NumPy array of data values that holds some spatial data where each
axis corresponds to the XYZ cartesian axes. This example will create a
:class:`pyvista.UniformGrid` object that will hold the spatial reference for
a 3D grid which a 3D NumPy array of values can be plotted against.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 19-22

Create the 3D NumPy array of spatially referenced data.
This is spatially referenced such that the grid is 20 by 5 by 10
(nx by ny by nz)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-43

.. code-block:: default

    values = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000).reshape((20, 5, 10))
    values.shape

    # Create the spatial reference
    grid = pv.UniformGrid()

    # Set the grid dimensions: shape + 1 because we want to inject our values on
    #   the CELL data
    grid.dimensions = np.array(values.shape) + 1

    # Edit the spatial reference
    grid.origin = (100, 33, 55.6)  # The bottom left corner of the data set
    grid.spacing = (1, 5, 2)  # These are the cell sizes along each axis

    # Add the data values to the cell data
    grid.cell_data["values"] = values.flatten(order="F")  # Flatten the array!

    # Now plot the grid!
    grid.plot(show_edges=True)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-47

Don't like cell data? You could also add the NumPy array to the point data of
a :class:`pyvista.UniformGrid`. Take note of the subtle difference when
setting the grid dimensions upon initialization.
