    "\n",
    "[PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista) is a general purpose 3D visualization library used for over 500+ open source projects and many closed source projects for the visualization of everything from [computer aided engineering and geophysics to volcanoes and digital artwork](https://dev.pyvista.org/getting-started/external_examples.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PyVista exposes a Pythonic API to the [Visualization Toolkit (VTK)](http://www.vtk.org) to provide tooling that is immediately usable without any prior knowledge of VTK and is being built as the 3D equivalent of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), with plugins to [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) to enable visualization of 3D data using both server and client-side rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will provide a hands-on tutorial accessible to anyone with internet access and a computer via many of PyVista's existing [example Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.pyvista.org/examples/index.html) and new material through a comprehensive overview highlighting popular 3D visualization use cases."

    "- Use PyVista to create 3D visualizations from a variety of datasets in common formats.\n",
    "- Overview the classes and data structures of PyVista with real-world examples.\n",
    "- Be familiar of the various filters and features of PyVista.\n",
    "- Know which Python libraries are used and can be used by PyVista (meshio, trimesh etc).\n",

    "1. Basic knowledge of Python to get started. Be able to install Jupyter Lab on your machine and be up and running.\n",
    "2. Intermediate users will want to be familiar with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and other libraries that are compatible with PyVista, like [trimesh](https://trimsh.org/examples.html) or [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio).\n",
    "3. Advanced users should be familiar the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), general data science, and GUI frameworks like Qt."
