Widgets in PyVista
==================

PyVista has several widgets that can be added to the rendering scene to control
filters like clipping, slicing, and thresholding - specifically there are
widgets to control the positions of boxes, planes, and lines or slider bars
which can all be highly customized through the use of custom callback
functions.

Here weâ€™ll take a look at the various widgets, some helper methods that
leverage those widgets to do common tasks, and demonstrate how to leverage the
widgets for user defined tasks and processing routines.

.. tip::

    This section of the tutorial was adopted from the `widgets section
    <https://docs.pyvista.org/examples/index.html?highlight=widgets#widgets>`_
    of the PyVista example documentation.
